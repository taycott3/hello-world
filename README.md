# hello-world
my first repository.
Ive been teaching myself to program for about 8 months now. I'll be attending school soon to obtain a CS degree, and want to have some work I can show prospective employers in the future. I'd also love to work with other people on projects so I can potentially learn some new tricks or get a fresh perspective on certain issues.
